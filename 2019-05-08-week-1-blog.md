# Week 1 blog
This week started out with extreme confusion. I had a long list of questions I was trying to answer, such as: what are the differences between fail logs and blog posts? Or, what purpose does the DH Box serve in this course? I managed to answer most of my questions on my own, through trial and error. Though I managed to solve most problems, there are still some things I'm not confident about. This is hardly a surprise, considering my nearly non-existant technical skills, but I don't doubt that, as I begin to practice and actually apply the things we covered this week, I'll quickly gain a more thorough understanding.       

## First Annotation
In one of my first annotations, I asked what the difference between fail logs and blogs is. The course manual and the workbook provided two different examples of fail logs that were completely different in what content was recorded, which I found to be incredibly confusing. Dr. Graham answered with an explanation, which did help to clear up the general difference between the two, but didn't resolve the issue of which fail log style was the 'right' one. So, I asked a follow-up question to determine this. It hadn't occurred to me that both were 'right' and it was simply a matter of preference. 

Now that this confusion has been cleared up, I am able to decide which style of fail log I'd like to follow, and how to structure my blog, as well. Since the class will involve coding, with which I'm not familiar, and since I often approach technical challenges by trying random buttons, I think I will most benefit from the more 'nuts-and-bolts' style (with somewhat detailed descriptions though!), and less from the paragraph/reflective style. Keeping track of what exactly I did will be vital for my success in this course. The narrative format I will apply to my blog, so that it's clearer why I was doing what I was doing.  

## Second Annotation
Another of my annotations was a reflection on how this class aligns with my personal interests regarding my studies. This annotation was made on "The Historian's Macroscope: Big Digital History" and discusses the Old Bailey. Truthfully, when I registered for this course, I knew it would be interesting but I didn't know how useful it would be to my future career path (not that I have this path figured out yet anyway). Because of my limited technical understanding, I haven't ever thought of the role of the digital in my studies as being anything greater than using Microsoft Word. However, as I was reading this text, I realized that digital history isn't as far removed from my experiences as I thought.     

To others, I'm sure this wouldn't seem like a novel idea, but I had simply not understood until then that digital history is integrated into how we do history today, even at the lowest levels. My annotation reflects on how I had interacted with the Old Bailey in the past, and how I was beginning to understand how digital history can be applied to further ideas and processes, even for 'basic' aspects of historical study.  

## Third Annotation
My third annotation (left on "The History Manifesto") connects to my second one, because I continued to reflect on how I have interacted and can interact with digital history. Though in the previous annotation I discussed my realizations regarding how I have benefitted from this, in this one I wondered how useful this could truly be to me, as an historian of ancient Greek history. Certainly, I've used digital tools in my studies, such as the databases Perseus and ORBIS, but since there's so little surviving documentation from antiquity, I am not sure how useful DH is to my focus compared to other, more modern, historical focuses.  

As the course continues, and I get deeper into the world of digital history, I'll be able to reflect on this doubt with a deeper understanding. Perhaps I'll still feel the same way, but more likely, I think I'll have realized that I simply hadn't known how many possibilities DH creates for ancient Greek history. I look forward to learning more about this.

## Comments/Concerns

This week began with the belief that I was in way over my head. As it progressed, and I slowly started answering my own questions and getting the hang of some things, I started to feel more at ease. I definitely still have worries about the course, though. While most of my questions have been answered, there are still some things I'm not 100% clear on yet. However, I want to wait until we really get into the swing of things to see whether that clears up. I've often found that the first week of a course feels a bit all over the place until you get used to it. 

The biggest problem I encountered this week, which I have not yet overcome, is my trouble with setting up DH Box. It is still not up and running, and I don't understand why. I've sought help from Dr. Graham a few times this week with this, but it hasn't been resolved yet. The latest development was that my issues might have been caused by my adblocker being on, so I've turned it off and will keep trying. In trying to figure out the problem, Dr. Graham created a week-long DH Box for me (and it worked perfectly) which I will use until this is sorted out. He has also assured me that if nothing changes, he will simply make another DH Box for me. 

I look forward to diving into the first exercises and really getting a feel for digital history.
